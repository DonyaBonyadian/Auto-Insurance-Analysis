# Auto-Insurance-Analysis

**Project Description:**  
Auto insurance provides financial protection to customers against physical damage, resulting from traffic collisions and theft of vehicles. In addition, it covers the cost associated with injuries, death, or property damage caused by the insured owner of the vehicle to another driver, vehicle, or property such as a fence, building, or utility pole. Although auto insurance requirements vary from state to state, bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage have been mandated in many jurisdictions before using or keeping a vehicle on public roads. The auto insurance market exhibits high growth potential as the number of road accidents is increasing in most countries across the globe.

The purpose of this project is to understand the main factors that drive customer tenure within the auto insurance industry for one or more years. The analysis is based on 12 months of United States Auto Insurance survey data.
